There are many NPC configuration options not covered in the video and wiki. For advanced configuration, please refer to the following wikis.

# Hiring NPCs
You can hire NPCs with money. This server uses Gringotts, which means gold ingots and gold blocks are money. Each NPC costs $10, and you hire as many NPCs as you want with the /hire (# NPCs) command. Ex: /hire 2  will hire 2 NPCs.

NPCs will spawn on a random block nearby with no items. An NPC can be selected by right clicking with a stick or by looking at the NPC and using /npc select.

# Equipment
You can equip your NPCs with weapons and armor as well as give them items to carry.

/npc equip opens a menu for equipping the NPC with armor, a weapon, and a shield.

/npc inventory opens a menu for giving the NPC items. You can also place weapons in the inventory, and the NPC will equip them when it is time to fight. If you equip your NPC with a melee weapon and a ranged weapon, the NPC will automatically switch weapons if necessary depending on its distance from the enemy.

# Pathing
The /npc path command will enter you into pathing mode, which allows you to set a path that the selected NPC will follow. This is useful for setting patrol routes for NPC guards. Any NPCs not in combat and not following a player will return to their path.
