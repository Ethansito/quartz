title: Sign Shop
---
# Introduction
The Sign Shop plugin allows players to buy, sell, and trade items without both players being on the server at the same time and place. To create a shop, you link a chest with a sign that has the desired function, such as selling trading leather boots for diamonds.

**Note**: Total War: Age of Blood does not balance itself around money. Money currently has no use. This plugin should be used for making barter shops only, where items are swapped for other items.
