# Explanation
AntiFarm is a plugin that prevents players from afk farming items and experience. If the player does not do enough damage to the mob, it will not drop anything when it dies. There is also an anti-afk-fishing feature that prevents players from fishing in the same chunk for too long. 

Animal farms are also affected by this plugin. Chickens and frogs need to be fed to continue producing eggs and frog lights. Cows need to be fed or wait out a cooldown to continue producing milk.
