# Introduction
The Dynmap, or "Dynamic Map" is like google earth but for Minecraft, allowing you to see the worlds on the server from a flat, top-down view, an isometric view, or a cave view. Any dark spots on the map are places that have never been rendered before. The entire earth was pre-rendered, but the nether and the end were not, meaning the dark spots in those dimensions are unexplored territory.

# Usage
There is not much to do with the Dynmap other than to look at it and plan your settlement, or the demise of an enemy. The Dynmap will also track players by default, allowing you to see their approximate location, health, and armor. If you do not want to be tracked, you can toggle Dynmap tracking with `/dynmap hide`. Finally, you can see server chat on the Dynmap, but you cannot chat with players on the server from the Dynmap, a feature that has been turned off due to ban dodging.
