# Explanation
The MyDog plugin improves on wolves by giving them a random name and a level-up system. Your wolves will improve as they kill mobs. You can also toggle whether they are being aggressive or defensive. Wolves have improved teleportation skills so they get lost less often when traveling. However, death is still permanent for wolves.
